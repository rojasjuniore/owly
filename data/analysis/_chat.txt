[23/07/25, 5:08:36 p.m.] Diriana Teran Lending Spot: Team, I wanted to share something important that happened to a client I closed a few years ago.
The investor who purchased the loan (Select Portfolio) sent him a notice about an escrow shortage, possibly due to unpaid taxes at closing. That caught my attention.

It turns out Select Portfolio was paying property taxes twice a year, claiming that’s how it’s done in Miami. The rep simply said, “That’s the order we have.”

They’re now refunding the extra payments to the client.

Just a reminder: Even if it’s a bank, always double-check escrow and tax payments—not everything they do is accurate.

Incredible for me!!!
[23/07/25, 5:09:44 p.m.] Jim Lending Spot lobo: Thank you young lady

[24/07/25, 7:54:58 p.m.] Karla D Lending Spot: Hi, can anyone provide any insight for an FHA self employed client. If the increase in income from 23-24 is very high (40k for 2023 and 150k for 2024) - is this ok as long as i average over 24 months? Will i need to document the increase in any other way beside a p&l ?
[24/07/25, 7:56:15 p.m.] Xavier Lending Spot: You can use the agárrate. UW will most likely need an LOI explain the drastic increase.
[24/07/25, 7:56:31 p.m.] Xavier Lending Spot: *Average
[24/07/25, 8:01:27 p.m.] Karla D Lending Spot: thank you. If 2023 was a schedule C and 2024 is an 1120-S with same EIN its ok right?
[24/07/25, 8:09:20 p.m.] Xavier Lending Spot: That actually supports the increase is income.
[24/07/25, 8:16:35 p.m.] jose Lending Spot gc&mortgages: unless owner related to him. been there 😪

[25/07/25, 9:24:45 a.m.] Xavier Lending Spot: Good morning team. Just a quick update on a fanny guideline. Any property in which title is being held in the name of an LLC and being transferred to a personal name when doing a refinance needs to be done prior to closing it can no longer be done at closing.

[25/07/25, 10:32:08 a.m.] Dario Jimenez Lending Spot: Should be fine. If there was a gap in payments you'll have to document it though. To be sure follow Danny's guidance.

[19/08/25, 8:25:12 a.m.] jose Lending Spot gc&mortgages: has anyone ever gotten a condition in Fl of the water heater needing to be double strapped? on fha appraisal?
[19/08/25, 8:48:11 a.m.] Daniel Eguiguren LS: What?
[19/08/25, 8:48:22 a.m.] Daniel Eguiguren LS: Never ever heard of that
[19/08/25, 8:48:35 a.m.] Daniel Eguiguren LS: Do you know who the appraiser is?
[19/08/25, 8:49:01 a.m.] Daniel Eguiguren LS: Jose, send me the appraisal report
[19/08/25, 8:49:41 a.m.] ~ Melissa: We’ve had to get a pan under the water heater installed
[19/08/25, 8:55:46 a.m.] Rafael Falero LS: I've had the pan issue also
[19/08/25, 8:58:23 a.m.] jose Lending Spot gc&mortgages: googled it and mainly s califonia requiremnt for earthquakes but not here
[19/08/25, 9:03:33 a.m.] Danielle Moser Ls: Jose, that is correct, it is only a California requirement. Fannie and Freddie require us to comply with federal, state and local laws. It is only found in the California local requirements, Health and Safety code 19211. Florida does not have a state law or building code that requires water heaters to be strapped or braced. It's only a California/West Coast earthquake thing.
[19/08/25, 9:10:37 a.m.] Daniel Eguiguren LS: JOSE, I spoke to one of our appraisers and he says that does not pertain to Florida
[19/08/25, 9:10:52 a.m.] Dario Jimenez Lending Spot: Maybe the appraiser wants it strapped so the hurricane doesn't blow it away... 🤣
[19/08/25, 9:33:08 a.m.] jose Lending Spot gc&mortgages: yea thats actually a code so it wont ve knocked over
[19/08/25, 12:29:44 p.m.] Karla D Lending Spot: anyone know if VA has an anti flip rule like FHA requiring 2 appraisals if there was a sale in the last 6 months?
[19/08/25, 12:34:12 p.m.] Danielle Moser Ls: VA does not have any flip rule. The underwriter may be cautious if the resale price is significantly higher than the purchase price and may request receipts or repair logs to support the increase, but that would be underwriter scrutiny, not a VA rule.
[19/08/25, 12:35:09 p.m.] Karla D Lending Spot: okay great thanks danielle !

[25/08/25, 9:44:17 a.m.] Daniel Eguiguren LS: Good morning everyone does anyone know of a lender that does a P&L without bank statement and is lenient on the Condo questionnaire. I cannot send it to deep Haven since they require bank statements.

[25/08/25, 10:18:27 a.m.] Alejandro Lending Spot: @⁨Daniel Eguiguren LS⁩ Cake has an Intense Limited Review Condo Questionnaire. A couple of the questions aren't Limited Review in nature.
[25/08/25, 10:30:06 a.m.] Oscar G Mendez: @⁨Daniel Eguiguren LS⁩ I second that motion, CAKE is deep and thorough for their condo reviews. We've went thru 2 of them recently.

I was with him already but the DTI was 48, I am probably going to add the wife but her score affects the rate. So was wondering what my other options were.

[29/08/25, 9:32:20 a.m.] Jaime Luna Lending Spot: With SpringEQ your client can pay back it back but they won’t be able to access it again for 90 days. They also go to 50% DTI but it requires 700 credit and $3,500 in disposable income. FYI, they only use Experian for the credit score

[15/09/25, 4:02:25 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: Need a recommendation please. I have a loan near ready to close. Loan is with PHH.  Good borrowers. Appraisal came back at value as is.  The UW is now adding subject to conditions for mostly cosmetic (drywall repair, floor covering) items that they are requiring before closing. Customer is making repairs as soon as they close. It is a bank foreclosure. Who would you recommend I can move this loan to that would be pretty fast?  I still have two weeks for closing date. Conventional loan.  Any recommendations?
[15/09/25, 4:29:38 p.m.] Daniel Eguiguren LS: LoanStore

[15/09/25, 4:38:44 p.m.] Diego A Londono Londono: Mega...they are moving fast right now.
[15/09/25, 4:39:10 p.m.] Daniel Eguiguren LS: I think we just need to make sure that the new lender underwriter doesn’t tear apart the appraisal
[15/09/25, 4:43:41 p.m.] Xavier Lending Spot: I would contact your rep and share the report so that you don’t run into a surprise.
[15/09/25, 4:49:48 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: Absolutely agree Xavier.  I wanted suggestion on lender and was going to do just that. Thank you all

[15/09/25, 5:09:55 p.m.] Dario Jimenez Lending Spot: Do we know who the UW manager is? Can we get management from the appraisal team to chime in? I'd hate to see you move the whole file over an Id ten t error.
[15/09/25, 5:21:35 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: We appealed it and it came back that they will not budge. I will
make another call in the morning.
[15/09/25, 6:07:44 p.m.] Arthur Miguez Tu Mejor Amigo: i just saw the appraisal the house is rough shape and has some safety issues with the floor your best bet might michigan mutual as they are the most fleixible when it comes to repairs
[15/09/25, 6:09:45 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: Thanks Arthur. I agree with one issue that is safety but I have had concrete floors before with no covering.  It is a foreclosure but we were able to get insurance with no issues.
[15/09/25, 6:10:44 p.m.] Arthur Miguez Tu Mejor Amigo: i sent the report to Diego to take a second look
[15/09/25, 6:11:41 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: The UW went to the house so if true safety issues he would have seen them. The water tank covering I def agree.
[15/09/25, 6:15:29 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: They decided against Reno loan because costs were less than 20k and they did not want to use a GC

We’ve prepared a new post about the DSCR Loan Program — a powerful tool for real estate investors where rental income (not personal income) is what qualifies the deal.

To make it simple, we created two caption options (A/B) so you can pick the one that fits your style best. Just copy, paste, and post 📲.

If you need a personalized version, email 📩 marketing_requests@lendingspot.net or write me directly at 📩 jlondono@lendingspot.net.

[24/09/25, 10:54:14 a.m.] Juan Londoño: 💼 Stop waiting on banks to “verify” your income.
With a DSCR loan, your rental property’s cash flow does the talking.

[25/09/25, 12:38:30 p.m.] Jamie LO LS: Does anyone know who our rep is at Sunwest Mortgage?  I have a VA Cash Out Refi with a 564 credit score that needs to go manual.  I have a DU refer eligible.
[25/09/25, 2:57:17 p.m.] Tanita Lending Spot: FL Housing question: can we stack the FL Bond with a County DPA also under FL Housing program?
[25/09/25, 3:02:10 p.m.] Daniel Eguiguren LS: Ray should be able to answer this and I’m almost certain you can do it
[25/09/25, 3:07:17 p.m.] Diego A Londono Londono: I believe you can but we will let Ray answer ‎<Se editó este mensaje.>

[25/09/25, 3:10:45 p.m.] Diego A Londono Londono: Yes
[25/09/25, 3:16:32 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: I know this is a stretch but is there anyone out there that will allow a borrower to do about 35k in repairs, i.e installs floors, repair drywall, etc  on their own for Reno loan?  Plaza is a no. Mi Mutual is a no?  Anything Non QM
[25/09/25, 3:17:01 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: Needing someone with connections with TLS
[25/09/25, 3:18:21 p.m.] ~ Adrian Borrego: Maybe they will allow for the borrower to put their own funds into an escrow account only for the use of that?  

Not sure just a thought.
[25/09/25, 3:31:00 p.m.] Diego A Londono Londono: That's too much in repairs nobody's will allow them to do it on their own
[25/09/25, 3:36:25 p.m.] Dario Jimenez Lending Spot: Yes you can. Lots of work but it can be done. just make sure the county DPA is good with being in 3rd position.
[25/09/25, 3:50:03 p.m.] ~ Ray Guerra Loan Officer: The only one I have confirmed that you can stack is with Miami Dade 
Ehousing has to go in 2nd lien position and Miami Dade MDEAT will go in 3rd
[25/09/25, 3:50:56 p.m.] ~ Ray Guerra Loan Officer: Dario is correct you have to check with the county because ehousing will NOT go in 3rd

I am getting my processes down and I am just so grateful for everyone willing to answer my million questions while I got up and running. Thanks a million.

[30/09/25, 8:07:09 a.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: I closed a DSCR with the Loan Store on Saturday and the Investor was actually Verus Capital. I was a little shocked by that. I would have gone with Verus Capital directly had I known.
[30/09/25, 8:08:54 a.m.] ~ Adrian Borrego: Verus underwriting is terrible
[30/09/25, 8:09:02 a.m.] ~ Adrian Borrego: But they are priced well
[30/09/25, 8:09:08 a.m.] Xavier Lending Spot: Loan Store
Logan

Allot more.

I would run LoanSifter and see all your options. To many to write down. 

My advice

Hi Lending Spot family. My daughter (Abby) and her school dance team are on the way to Nationals this year. In order to get her to Nationals I need to raise $3,000. In one last push I’m sending it out to the work fam to see if I’m able to meet this goal. Please help me get Abby to Nationals!!!!

[30/09/25, 10:04:47 a.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: Thanks everyone. I closed it with Loan Store but surprised the investor showed as Verus. I confirmed with LS that was correct. The UW was a lot for closing in a business.  We got it done though.
[30/09/25, 10:14:38 a.m.] Jaime Luna Lending Spot: Good morning, do we have lenders for a cash out DSCR where the loan will not show in the borrower’s credit report?
[30/09/25, 10:20:27 a.m.] Diego A Londono Londono: I do these all the time every lender will accept it you just need a payment history phone number the current holder and 12 months canceled checks from your consumer
[30/09/25, 10:24:58 a.m.] Juan Londono: Hi team 👋,

We’ve created a new post about DSCR Loans — perfect for investors who don’t have W2s and qualify based on rental cash flow.

[1/10/25, 6:25:59 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: If I never hear Rocket Mortgage again it will be too soon. I see why my listing agents will never accept an offer if they are the lender.  I have used some great lenders and some not so great but this has to be the WORST.  Ok vent over
[1/10/25, 6:27:10 p.m.] Dario Jimenez Lending Spot: What happened?
[1/10/25, 6:29:07 p.m.] Daniel Eguiguren LS: Cynthia what happened because when we use Rocket on mini core side it shows no where that Rocket is the lender
[1/10/25, 6:38:30 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: We have been conversing over reserves that we have but they say we do not. Danielle has tried talking to them but they are not having it. I got a transaction history with a military deposit today that I hope will satisfy them. I don’t even know. Their grown daughter lives with and cares for them. She works a full time job as well. This is a VA loan and they are counting her as a dependent. She is not on the loan. We sent the numerous paystubs to show she works. (UW directed me to do that) The school board where she works does not list YTD pay on the stub. I know it is weird. We sent her 2023 and 2024 tax return and her W2’s to support that she has been working. She has worked same job since 2013.  They say no that does not prove that she is not a dependent. I have never been so frustrated. It is a VA loan and I have never been so frustrated. I do many VA loans and have never in my life run into this. ‎<Se editó este mensaje.>
[1/10/25, 6:46:45 p.m.] Xavier Lending Spot: Cynthia.

What’s the name and loan number? 

Let em try and make a call for you.
[1/10/25, 6:48:33 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: Larry Thompson Rocket Loan 3570639220
[1/10/25, 6:49:41 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: I am not a rookie and do understand underwriting I do not understand this
[1/10/25, 6:51:41 p.m.] Diego A Londono Londono: what is your closing date?
[1/10/25, 6:51:44 p.m.] Xavier Lending Spot: Cynthia.

Can you request a copy
Of the daughter’s tax returns? I think that would prove she is not a dependent if the check the box which asked if someone else can claim you.
[1/10/25, 6:52:05 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: Xavier this is what was added today. *updated 10/01/2025: documentation doesn't show dependent's year to date income (just taxable wage information and deductions). Year to date totals. Per our pathfinder guidelines for us to exclude daughter as a dependent we need to have a paystub with a year to date totals for 2025. Thank you.
[1/10/25, 6:52:49 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: It was last Friday
[1/10/25, 6:55:18 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: She files her own tax returns and claims herself. I sent the her 2023 and 2024 tax returns. It will take me two weeks to get a WVOE because that county is so slow.
[1/10/25, 6:58:12 p.m.] Daniel Eguiguren LS: Team other than Windsor who has a solid condo team
[1/10/25, 7:00:50 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: Her tax return does not have the box checked  that someone can claim you as a dependent. I have mom and dad’s return also and they do not claim her as a dependent.
[1/10/25, 7:02:02 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: Sorry for venting. It has been a day.

[7/10/25, 2:09:01 p.m.] Ileana Borroto Lending Spot: WARNING - Heads up for anyone considering Deephaven/NDC for non-warrantable condos or any type of loan that would need an exception. In addition to taking a minimum of 3 to 4  business days for conditions to be reviewed by underwriting once uploaded, they will not request an exception until all conditions have been received. TeamPerez just now received a DENIAL on both loans due to square footage being less than 600 sq ft in spite of *underwriting having the appraisal reports on 9/24* along with title and other conditions.
[7/10/25, 2:15:05 p.m.] German Mesa LS: Is it a condotel?

[8/10/25, 9:57:54 a.m.] jose Lending Spot gc&mortgages: yup and it was a non warrantable condo. Pretty smooth

[16/10/25, 12:34:51 p.m.] Karla D Lending Spot: for MDEAT if youve owned a home in the last 3 years but not currently , are they able to get the DPA ?
[16/10/25, 12:52:42 p.m.] James  Dugard LS: I don’t think so because if you own a property within 3 years you are not considered a first time home buyer
[16/10/25, 12:55:26 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: Not a first time homebuyer unless you were a displaced homemaker. There are programs that allow for that as a FTHB. The State of FL DPA programs do not recognize it though.
[16/10/25, 1:57:36 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: I have a new app and borrower is W2 30k per month salary. He also started a new business in July (I excluded that income). My issue is his credit is 638 and he wants to buy 900k home. His credit is low because of the types of accounts he used to get money to open the business.  DTI is not a problem. His reserves are in cryptocurrency.  My brain is fried on this one. Any hope of getting this one done?
[16/10/25, 1:59:07 p.m.] Daniel Eguiguren LS: What is your LTV
[16/10/25, 2:00:24 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: I would think I can do more than 90. He has 100k. If I used all of that I would have to get seller concessions
[16/10/25, 2:00:39 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: 90 is max
[16/10/25, 2:02:03 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: The value of the home is 1.2m so maybe a closed end second to get to 80 or 75? That is a low credit for that approach
[16/10/25, 2:02:37 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: I will call the AE at change to see what they have
[16/10/25, 2:23:34 p.m.] Daniel Eguiguren LS: Are you not getting an approved eligible?
[16/10/25, 2:24:15 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: I have even been able to get pricing. No eligible products
[16/10/25, 2:34:40 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: Who do we use if we need to raise FICO?
[16/10/25, 2:35:24 p.m.] jose Lending Spot gc&mortgages: jennifer@pcbscore.com

[17/10/25, 11:45:42 a.m.] Gina Montes: Before i start calling everyone who are your go to for voe only program or no income verification for a primary home. Gracias :) ‎<Se editó este mensaje.>
[17/10/25, 11:48:10 a.m.] ~ Adrian Borrego: Change or Champions for true no income for Primary, needs with them are reserves and credit score
[17/10/25, 11:49:06 a.m.] ~ Adrian Borrego: Depending on LTV and score cash out can be used for reserves
[17/10/25, 1:10:02 p.m.] Gina Montes: Do we lend in Vermont?
[17/10/25, 1:10:45 p.m.] Daniel Eguiguren LS: Investment only

[18/10/25, 8:43:55 a.m.] jose Lending Spot gc&mortgages: good morning! does PRMG allow ptin for ytd pnl and balance sheet on fha?
[18/10/25, 8:54:41 a.m.] Xavier Lending Spot: I think they allow self prepared. Do you have a loan commitment asking for a CPA?
[18/10/25, 8:55:09 a.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: Thank you
[18/10/25, 8:56:10 a.m.] jose Lending Spot gc&mortgages: self.prepared even better! approval but it doesn't mention that part.
[18/10/25, 9:07:56 a.m.] Xavier Lending Spot: If it’s not asking you specifically for a CPA to prepare, the borrower should be able to produce
[18/10/25, 9:09:37 a.m.] Xavier Lending Spot: “If the Borrower is self-employed, the Mortgagee must obtain a year-to-date profit and loss (P&L) statement and balance sheet.
A P&L statement does not have to be audited.
If the P&L statement is unaudited, it may be prepared by the borrowerself-prepared P&L statements are acceptable under FHA guidelines.

[24/10/25, 12:44:29 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: I know I ask a lot of questions but I am trying to get to know these lender’s. I have a 1M purchase and the borrower is a Sales Manager at local dealership.  He told me he was salary but when I pulled info it is all under commission and varying amounts each month. It is at least 30k per month. He has only been on his job 16 months but has experience in the line of work.  Who might do a non QM with less than 2 years for a primary residence?
[24/10/25, 12:46:24 p.m.] Dario Jimenez Lending Spot: If you can complete at least the additional 8 months at a prior commission employment you shouldn't need to go non qm.
[24/10/25, 1:08:01 p.m.] Diego A Londono Londono: Almost all of them. Will let you use one year employment. Like I always tell you send me a screenshot of the top five or six lenders, and I’ll tell you who’s gonna be our best business partner. Have you sent it to me by text now? I’ll tell you where we can go.

[24/10/25, 1:16:16 p.m.] Dario Jimenez Lending Spot: I just know that with a full 24 I've never been questioned. Even when I financed my personal house. 🤷🏽‍♂️
[24/10/25, 1:21:02 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: Thanks. I have never had anyone take less than 2 years and his prior job was not commission. It was strictly salary

[24/10/25, 1:33:52 p.m.] ~ JK: The most important thing to establish is consistency and the likelihood of continuance. We did a few at PRMG, so they'll definitely do the loan.

[3/11/25, 11:13:59 a.m.] Diego A Londono Londono: Yes we do with STG
[3/11/25, 11:14:26 a.m.] Diego A Londono Londono: They are going to require one pay stub along with the VOE
[3/11/25, 11:30:45 a.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: I lost it and just trying to figure out how she was doing this.
Borrower is self employed and only had 12015 W2 income in 2023 and 24095 in 2024. I could only get 1900 per month traditional from tax returns because of write offs.  I suggested banks statement program with 90 LTV and he said
No. She is doing WVOE @3.5% down when he is the owner.  I will have to ask STG how that works
[3/11/25, 11:32:42 a.m.] Diego A Londono Londono: Ask STG.. Melissa will walk you through it
[3/11/25, 11:32:58 a.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: Will do
[3/11/25, 1:18:11 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: I spoke with STG and self employed borrowers are not eligible for this program even if they pay themselves W2 income
[3/11/25, 1:19:26 p.m.] Diego A Londono Londono: Give me a call after three because we’re meeting another program. I can fit you in.

[4/11/25, 3:20:57 p.m.] Dario Jimenez Lending Spot: Team does anyone know of a lender that will allow a new purchase or a refinance when the clients current property is in forbearance with a modificiation that starts payments next month? This was due to the Milton disaster. The home just got finished being repaired
[4/11/25, 3:48:30 p.m.] Tanita Lending Spot: Does anyone have a DocuSign account? My client's dad is having so many problems with signing in Arive. I need this ASAP as a condition to close.

Parents EAD card, no scores, nothing under name
10% gift funds for primary home.
I can’t do conventional family opportunity loan under daughters name because her ratios are not good enough. 

Any idea who would do a non traditional credit loan with 10% down no scores 250k purchase
I already priced in loansifter but no help for this scenario, ‎<Se editó este mensaje.>
[6/11/25, 3:53:10 p.m.] Daniel Eguiguren LS: Call Diego i think we may have an outlet. I was on a call with a new lender we are signing up with
[6/11/25, 4:01:33 p.m.] Gina Montes: Thank you just called him and will try again shortly :)  @⁨Diego A Londono Londono⁩

[6/11/25, 4:34:21 p.m.] Diego A Londono Londono: I will tell you we are not set for that yet .. but coming soon
[7/11/25, 7:24:51 a.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: Before this one completely busts checking for thoughts to see if there is something I have not tried. This is a 3.5 FHA DPA. FICO 628. Mfg home 1999.  Appraisal came in 12400 low. Seller is giving concessions and does not have enough equity to go down on purchase price because they are buying a new home. I tried Ship for 30k. She qualifies but the home cannot be more than 5 years old. This one is 6.  I am limited because borrower has limited funds. Thoughts?
[7/11/25, 7:25:34 a.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: I also tried one of the programs at TLS and it was a no go also
[7/11/25, 8:15:17 a.m.] Diego A Londono Londono: Have you tried Florida bond?
[7/11/25, 9:04:57 a.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: Fico is too low. Must have 640
[7/11/25, 9:13:31 a.m.] Jaime Luna Lending Spot: What about increasing the rate and giving a lender credit
[7/11/25, 1:28:38 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: I did and I am at the top of DTI that will approve
[7/11/25, 1:29:16 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: I would need about 14 k in lender credit and that is not available
[7/11/25, 1:41:43 p.m.] ~ Ray Guerra Loan Officer: Try chenoa program PRMG or CTC mortgage
[7/11/25, 1:45:17 p.m.] Dario Jimenez Lending Spot: What about any of the 100% FHA options? Click n Close has a 5% second so youd be able to finance an additional 1.5% on top.
‎[7/11/25, 1:48:00 p.m.] ~ Adrian Borrego: There is a solar panel FHA programs that’s gives up $13,000 they just have to finance solar panels. ‎imagen omitida

[7/11/25, 1:49:00 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: That is the one I tried and it would not work
[7/11/25, 1:49:46 p.m.] ~ Ray Guerra Loan Officer: Why would you wanna finance $13,000 or do a second mortgage when the shenoa program is Down Payment Assistance 600 credit score and you don’t have to pay it back
[7/11/25, 1:50:28 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: Click and close will not finance Mfg Homes unless the title is retired prior to closing
[7/11/25, 2:03:04 p.m.] Dario Jimenez Lending Spot: Is this the one through TLS?
[7/11/25, 2:03:12 p.m.] ~ Adrian Borrego: Yea
[7/11/25, 2:03:48 p.m.] Dario Jimenez Lending Spot: how is this priced? Every time I have looked into it, it doesn't make sense
[7/11/25, 2:08:43 p.m.] ~ Ray Guerra Loan Officer: I don’t know you have to go in 
they have two options one, one option is paying it back. The other option is forgivable.
I have four I’ve done it before with no problem. I always go to E housing first and county programs shenoa oh is my last resort.
[7/11/25, 2:13:21 p.m.] ~ Ray Guerra Loan Officer: Add to the program about the solar panels that’s great. The only problem you’re gonna have is after you install the solar panels on your house if you have citizens insurance and they find out citizens will drop you citizens will not ensure a property that has solar panels.
[7/11/25, 3:18:30 p.m.] Angelica Giraldo LS: Team, the Roam training is now.  John wants to know if you are joining.  Only 4 people have joined so far.

[7/11/25, 3:24:22 p.m.] Angelica Giraldo LS: I just sent it to the group via email
[7/11/25, 3:26:00 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: I just got it but I am in the car. I cannot join right now
[7/11/25, 3:28:34 p.m.] Diego A Londono Londono: No worries.. there will be other sessions
[7/11/25, 4:25:49 p.m.] Gina Montes: Not sure if there is any investor out there for this for one 

Title being held by a corporation since this March as the owner agreed to transfer title to avoid foreclosure and corporation took over mortgage payments while mortgage is still being held by previous owner. There was a 2nd mortgage heloc that hasn’t been paid and filed for foreclosure. The corporation wants to take over the liens and refinance to take the owner off of the mortgage.

This is an odd situation, is it even possible to help them  & use this property to secure a loan or will they have to find another way to figure this out? 
Ltv 50% and liens are for $135,000.
[7/11/25, 4:32:24 p.m.] Dario Jimenez Lending Spot: This sounds like a DSCR refi to me. They have been on title for more than 6 months so they are the legal owners. You may need to show proof of payment during that time. For the mortgages.
But as long as the prior owner isn't an owner of the llc, it should be fine. I know it sounds like a foreclosure bailout but I think your overthinking it.
[7/11/25, 5:33:56 p.m.] Daniel Eguiguren LS: More like a Private loan
[7/11/25, 5:35:56 p.m.] Dario Jimenez Lending Spot: Okay I've been wrong before 🤷🏽‍♂️
[7/11/25, 5:39:07 p.m.] Diego A Londono Londono: Call me on this Gino, but because of the foreclosure, you have no other option but to go with the private mortgage

[10/11/25, 10:08:02 a.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: Forgot about govt shutdown so likely not a great option anyway

[10/11/25, 3:00:24 p.m.] Daniel Eguiguren LS: Good afternoon to all I’m doing an FHA loan for a client and the current property they are buying has property taxes of 1800 has anyone had experience with any lender that  used that figure for qualifying purposes
[10/11/25, 3:04:44 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: Per year?
[10/11/25, 3:05:16 p.m.] Daniel Eguiguren LS: Yes, the property tax bill is 1800 a year super low, but I wanna use it for qualifying purposes
[10/11/25, 3:09:47 p.m.] ~ Adrian Borrego: I would call some AE's directly and see
[10/11/25, 3:12:39 p.m.] Dario Jimenez Lending Spot: Is that the current bill that just came out? If yes most lenders I have used have taken it. I know Mega, Sierra off the top of my head. It is primary right? you said FHA so I assume so.
[10/11/25, 3:20:52 p.m.] Tanita Lending Spot: I've had a similar case but the UW went with the taxes the Title company showed which was the lower amount as opposed to the "proposed" higher amount a tax calculator suggested
[10/11/25, 3:52:54 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: The lenders I use have taken it, with the exception of Sunwest
[10/11/25, 3:53:25 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: Sunwest does their own thing
[10/11/25, 4:12:40 p.m.] Jaime Luna Lending Spot: If I’m not mistaken Newrez will allow it

[12/11/25, 12:50:56 p.m.] Jenny Lending Spot Concepcion: ‼️ alert ‼️ 🤗 
Hi guys! I wanted to mention so this doesn’t happen to anyone else. 
I just closed a stand alone with symentry, and as per Jerry, he said I would be making 1.75 on the draw plus had the option to add a broker fee, which i did of $500. Well they don’t pay 1.75 on the draw. 
So I just made only  $500 on a $264k HELOC. 😤(Add to that I was working with this difficult customer for 4 months!) 
Maybe I’m the only one mistaken but wanted to share just in case! 😅
[12/11/25, 12:57:42 p.m.] Gina Montes: Ouch sorry Jenny. I will piggy back on a positive note how I used Deephaven, HELOAN was able to give 100k cash for a boat, at 8.375% making 6.125 points in total (2 in the front & 4.125 in the back). Once the loan was in line for review it took about 1 week to clear to close. 🔥🙏
[12/11/25, 1:01:42 p.m.] Jenny Lending Spot Concepcion: Thank Gina! Lesson learned  and moving forward but ouch is right. 
Deephaven is great. 😊 ‎<Se editó este mensaje.>

No reply from Vans, today finally I get reply that it not enough coverage . Lost 2 days, now I need to see about then raising it or hoping if they have enough reserves to get exception. Fingers crossed
[14/11/25, 1:44:52 p.m.] Jenny Lending Spot Concepcion: The nondel side of Deephaven without Ralph, has been underwhelming.

[20/11/25, 12:49:52 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: Couple things….. NEVER use Orion unless you want endless unnecessary underwriting.  They have just been horrible and the AE is fairly new and not knowledgeable. On the Positive: I cannot say enough good things about the team at Freedom Mortgage.

[20/11/25, 1:38:53 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: Sample of some issues. They will
Not accept the combined electronic cert. she wants everything separate. Hot VOR for positive rent history and 12 months receipts. She won’t approve without a lease agreement added no exception. One of my borrowers does not have a lease but I had them do a month to month lease to satisfy.   Just a few issues that did not need to happen. She wanted me to compute income and submit income calc when WVOEs came in. I had already submitted the income. It did not need to be this difficult a file.
[20/11/25, 2:32:50 p.m.] Danielle Moser Ls: Hi Team, Cardinal Financial call is now
[20/11/25, 5:47:58 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: I know we have the holidays but who would you say is a pretty fast UW for FHA DPA if we have everything including appraisal?

[21/11/25, 2:04:18 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: I used credit expert previously
[21/11/25, 2:10:38 p.m.] Dario Jimenez Lending Spot: Team does anyone know of a DSCR lender that will allow a RON? My client is a US citizen but is going to be in Ecuador.
[21/11/25, 2:12:04 p.m.] Victor Suarez Lending Spot: This happened to me once i couldn’t find a RON but had i had the time could have set up a POA
[21/11/25, 2:12:56 p.m.] Dario Jimenez Lending Spot: From what I remember or was told something changed and we cant do it on our own anymore. We can ask for the what if simulator through PCB. Whose name do you have? I email Jennifer Oyuela jennifer@pcbscore.com she typically sends the report within a day or two.
[21/11/25, 2:13:18 p.m.] Dario Jimenez Lending Spot: This is a great back up plan. Thank you for the suggestion!

[1/12/25, 5:38:52 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: I hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving.  Question. I have someone trying to refinance a home. He and fiancé split up and she wants off the mortgage.  He wants to keep the house but cannot qualify for a conventional
loan on his own. FICO is 699.  He two years employment and Asylum has been applied for but not yet approved. I have nothing to state he is permanent resident alien so I cannot go FHA,
Correct?   Any non QM I can put this refinance with?   I tried FNBA but the have LTV at 80% and it won’t work.  I appreciate any suggestions
[1/12/25, 5:40:16 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: Might work for new company we were on call with last week?
[1/12/25, 5:40:27 p.m.] Diego A Londono Londono: What’s the loan value 80% , on the refinance ?
[1/12/25, 5:48:46 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: Appraised value is 304k and he owes $273,750 per his mortgage statement. They bought the home early 2024. He has about 12k in the bank
[1/12/25, 5:49:46 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: Also 9.75 interest rate with FNBA
[1/12/25, 5:51:24 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: He has W2 job so I emailed Elena to see if she can do it

Do you know of any HELOC lenders that wont make me do a VOM on the first that will also allow me to use bank statements? I tried Figure and NFTY but the bank statements wont sync.

[3/12/25, 8:14:27 p.m.] Tanita Lending Spot: Hey Everyone. I have a really difficult FHA refi scenario that I couldn't get through PennyMac. The borrower wasn't transparent about a few things that came up in underwriting. Do any of you know a lenient investor that may be willing to work this scenario?
[3/12/25, 8:15:40 p.m.] Gina Montes: @⁨Tanita Lending Spot⁩ remember I mentioned run from Penny if you have an FHA. They are not easy to work with on FHA loans. What is the scenerio call me. ‎<Se editó este mensaje.>

[3/12/25, 10:30:43 p.m.] Tanita Lending Spot: The borrower didn't mention that her out of state home had a forbearance as well as her primary. And the HOA fees on the out of state property are 3+ months past due and the NY property.
[3/12/25, 10:34:25 p.m.] Tanita Lending Spot: The NY property has a deferred principle amount of $16k and October was past due. Penny said past due and deferred balances are not allowed
[3/12/25, 10:55:53 p.m.] Gina Montes: Oh this was not penny this was definitely the client 🫣

How many payments have they made on time after the forbearance? And can they get current on their HOA? I’m thinking conventional now, I don’t think fha is an option. Maybe nonqm as well but will need more money down.

[4/12/25, 2:59:16 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: Just a quick update for everyone since we are about to be in Refi season. It looks like I found a home for my borrower.
Sunwest said they would only average 2024 and 2025 for
Variable income and gave me more that I anticipated. His home is financed Freddie now and he has made the payments from his funds for the past 12 months. I can do Freddie Refi Possible and it is reduced doc and they tell me I can go to 65 DTI. That is a win!
[4/12/25, 3:09:35 p.m.] Diego A Londono Londono: Thank you 🙏
[4/12/25, 3:12:05 p.m.] Dario Jimenez Lending Spot: Now if we could get their closing team to be just as awesome we'd be golden!

[4/12/25, 3:20:10 p.m.] Danielle Moser Ls: Jamie, Sun West also goes down to 500 FICO
[4/12/25, 3:20:57 p.m.] Diego A Londono Londono: Why 65 DTI?
[4/12/25, 3:23:56 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: His DTI is 52 and he is not perm resident so I was having trouble with it other than non QM. He did not have the money for 75 and 80 LTV.  I need a higher DTI requirement and they said o can go to 65 DTI with this program. I don’t need it that high but it lets me get it done with what I have
[4/12/25, 3:25:06 p.m.] Diego A Londono Londono: That’s amazing 65% on refi possible

[4/12/25, 4:58:59 p.m.] Alejandro Lending Spot: **Guidance**
What do we think of STG Mortgage and Resi Central ? They are pricing the same and need to pick the quickest.
[4/12/25, 5:46:53 p.m.] Diego A Londono Londono: boht are good
[4/12/25, 5:53:00 p.m.] Danielle Moser Ls: The only input I have is that ResiCentral advertised quick turnaround times and 10 days closings.

[12/12/25, 1:27:41 p.m.] ~ Adrian Borrego: Financed Discount Points
and/or Broker Origination
Fees:                                                                                                                                                                                         
HomeXpress will finance up to two (2) percent of the base loan amount
that may be used to pay discount points, broker origination fees,
and/or buyer’s realtor fees. These funds used will be reflected in the
LTV, however pricing of the loan will be based on the base LTV. Further,
this increase is allowed on all loans up to a combined total 80% LTV and
although the LTV is beyond the “base” LTV, it will not be viewed as an
exception to the loan program. ‎<Se editó este mensaje.>

[30/12/25, 11:44:12 a.m.] Cindy Jaramillo LS: Morning! I have a DSCR loan coming in, can someone advise on best investors 80 LTV loan amount $152,000? Thank you!
[30/12/25, 11:45:01 a.m.] James  Dugard LS: I’d go with whoever is priced best. Give me a call and we can price it out together
[30/12/25, 12:02:31 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: I always welcome personalized posts
[30/12/25, 12:03:39 p.m.] Diego A Londono Londono: Agreed to see who’s pricing out Best and send me the table. I’ll tell you who we can work with.
[30/12/25, 12:04:42 p.m.] Cynthia Lending Spot: I have a DSCR request on rural property 22 acres and a home.  It is next to a hunting camp so it will cash flow.   Who is best with rural properties?
[30/12/25, 12:10:11 p.m.] Diego A Londono Londono: I do have that somewhere hold on one second

[30/12/25, 2:42:39 p.m.] Arthur Miguez Tu Mejor Amigo: @⁨Cynthia Lending Spot⁩ send me the property address and ill see if i can pull some rental comps for you
[30/12/25, 7:05:54 p.m.] Tanita Lending Spot: @⁨Cindy Jaramillo LS⁩ I saw a few investors that will do 85 LTV if the credit score is in the 700s
[30/12/25, 8:20:17 p.m.] Cindy Jaramillo LS: Thanks!
[30/12/25, 11:00:04 p.m.] Arthur Miguez Tu Mejor Amigo: At 80% cash flow is usually tight for DSCR. And with a small loan amount rate doesn’t move the needle as much so I would price out at both 80 and 75 % ltv just in case as it can make a difference
[30/12/25, 11:01:42 p.m.] Arthur Miguez Tu Mejor Amigo: And what AMC you choose for appraisal can help as well send me the loan info and I’ll request a pencil search

Do a heloan. B2 is not on the mortgage but on title. B1 on mortgage but self employed and a hot mess. Just want to use b2 but cannot count first mortgage in his DTI. Suggestions

[28/01/26, 8:07:57 p.m.] Dario Jimenez Lending Spot: Is B1 credit shot? I don't know if you saw my earlier message that I deleted but Real TPO includes the 1st no matter what. I originally tried with Silvio Paul Ruiz 888-943-2833  Solutions@WMD.Mortgage you may want to call or email him to check. If not both RealTPO and WMD will allow bank statements for income on your B1 but you'll want to have decent credit. (If good credit id try NFTY first though)
[29/01/26, 8:53:24 a.m.] Cindy Jaramillo LS: Deephaven Figure it tells you in 10 minutes if they have an offer and they use the AVM, link bank accounts through Plaid for income, no docs.
[29/01/26, 8:56:24 a.m.] Gina Montes: I love deephaven even more now haha! Spring EQ seems to work the same, best pricing but I have a primary home so haven’t checked about it being DSCR. Good to know deephaven is that easy with investment properties too!!! That’s the one I made 6.25 points on the HELOAN! I think Deephaven fo the win 🎉💪😂
[29/01/26, 8:57:12 a.m.] Cindy Jaramillo LS: It was SUPER easy!

[7/02/26, 1:09:06 p.m.] ~ JK: June Point is a recently added investor, I don't think we've funded anything with them yet, but their pricing looked good when running scenarios this week. DSCR should be smooth; but make sure the borrower is not a FTHB or first time investor. If they are, reach out to the June Point AE for thier overlays just in case.
[7/02/26, 1:10:04 p.m.] ~ 🎀Yesenia Cordoba 🎀: Thank you!
